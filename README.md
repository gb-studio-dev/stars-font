# GB Studio Stars Font

This font was created in 2018 to be used in the game that eventually became [Untitled GB Game](https://github.com/chrismaltby/untitled-gb-game) and was later used as the default monospace font in [GB Studio](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio).

The optimum font size and line height is 8px. Only the uppercase letters are included as my game engine only supported that at the time I made this font.

Feel free to use this in any of your projects!
